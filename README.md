The assignment involves learning parameters for a Bayesian Network used in medical diagnosis. Given a Bayesian Network structure in .bif format with missing probability values represented as -1, the goal is to compute these values based on a healthcare dataset containing patient records, enabling accurate diagnosis in the real-world medical scenario. The output should provide the completed Bayesian Network in the .bif format with learned probability values.
