This assignment is about using SAT solvers to solve problems involving hidden connections within networks, like uncovering drug agencies from telephone records
In both parts of the assignment, we model the problem using graphs, where each node represents a person and edges represent phone conversations between them. In Part I, we aim to find two separate drug agencies within this graph, ensuring that they don't share any common members and satisfy certain size criteria. Part II focuses on finding the largest possible drug agency within the graph. To solve these problems, we encode them into (CNF) SAT formulas, which can be efficiently solved using SAT solvers like miniSAT.
